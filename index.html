            <!-- <h3 class="first">About</h3> -->

            <p>The first Vue 2 custom scrollbar library that only enhances scrolling instead of reimplementing it with custom scroll behavior. Created by <a href="https://serafin.io/">Dominik Serafin.</a></p>

            <p>It uses native scroll events to detect and synchronize scrollbar position. This makes possible to hack into the native events of scrolling element without hassle.</p>

            <p> It was built for <a href="https://ggather.com/">GGather.com</a> where it plays nicely with a lot of dynamic content changes and most importantly infinite scrolling and drag and drop features. And now after testing, fixes, improvements and added customization options - it's ready to be shared with the world.</p>

<strong>&#x3C;/div&#x3E;</strong>
</pre></code>



            <h3>How it works</h3>

            <p>Every Vuebar scrollable content needs to be wrapped in parent element <code>el1</code> that hides the native browser scrollbar of the second parent element <code>el2</code> and it also contains the custom scrollbar element (referenced further as <code>dragger</code>) which gets appended automatically on the Vuebar initialization. </p>

            <p><strong>New in 0.0.6:</strong> Instead of hiding the scrollbar using <code>el1</code> Vuebar now has a <code>useScrollbarPseudo</code> feature that hides the scrollbar using pseudo element selector <code>::-webkit-scrollbar</code>. Due to browsers limitations for now it works only on desktop Chrome &amp; desktop Safari at the moment.</p>

            <p>The Vuebar internals listen to <code>el2</code> scroll event and synchronize <code>dragger</code> position when you scroll. And vice versa - when you directly use <code>dragger</code> it listens to mouse events to detect the position of dragger and sets scroll position of <code>el2</code>.</p>

            <p>Other than setting the scroll position when you use <code>dragger</code> the Vuebar doesn't interfere at all with native browser scrolling and you can listen to scroll/wheel/etc. events as you would normally do.</p>

            <p>This also means the scroll behavior will remain unchanged. You'll still be able to use mouse wheel click scrolling or touch scrolling with momentum. It doesn't try to reimplement the scrolling from scratch like most of similar libraries try (with bad results).</p>



            <h3>Public methods (experimental &amp; work in progress)</h3>

            <p>You can access them from your component context: <code>this.$vuebar</code>. Alternatively you can access them from your main Vue instance: <code>Vue.vuebar</code>. </p>

            <p>Every method needs to have passed Vuebar scroll container element as the first argument. You can do that easily using <code>$refs</code>.</p>

                    If you want to access internal Vuebar state (like scrollbar height, scrollbar top or even <code>dragger</code> element reference) then you can access <code>_vuebarState</code> property of element 1 with v-bar directive. Or you can use <code>getState</code> method.

                    Element <code>el1</code> has programmatically added styles <code>position: relative</code> and <code>overflow: hidden</code> so you can't change them without using <code>!important</code>. But you shouldn't do it anyway - your scrollbar will break.

        Every Vuebar element has a child <code>dragger</code> element. That element also has its own child - a <code>dragger-styler</code> element that's purely there for you to style it any way you want. You can also style the original <code>dragger</code> element - just remember it has <code>position: absolute</code> style always applied and <code>height</code> and <code>top</code> styles dynamically added &amp; changed when scrolling.


        <h3>Default Style</h3>

        <p>If you were looking for this library it means you want to style your scrollbars as you want - so Vuebar doesn't include default styles internally. But if you e.g. want to quickly try or understand how you should style Vuebar scrollbars then below are prepared default styles that you can copy-paste into your project.  </p>

            By examining data from the two volcanoes, Mr. Jones and his team suggested an alternative: The chemical signature, along with this double-track volcanism as it’s called, occurred three million years ago when the plates above the hot spot shifted direction, moving north. This shimmy rearranged zones of magma that are heated under different pressures in the shallower part of the mantle — when they cool, the volcanic rock that results reflects this difference. Previously stacked on top of one another, the movement of the plates exposed now geographically separates magma zones that fed the volcanoes individually. Mauna Loa, the biggest volcano on Earth — and one of the most active — covers half the Island of Hawaii. Just 35 miles to the northeast, Mauna Kea, known to native Hawaiians as Mauna a Wakea, rises nearly 14,000 feet above sea level. To them it represents a spiritual connection between our planet and the heavens above. These volcanoes, which have beguiled millions of tourists visiting the Hawaiian islands, have also plagued scientists with a long-running mystery: If they are so close together, how did they develop in two parallel tracks along the Hawaiian-Emperor chain formed over the same hot spot in the Pacific Ocean — and why are their chemical compositions so different? "We knew this was related to something much deeper, but we couldn’t see what,” said Tim Jones, an earth science Ph.D. student at Australian National University and the lead author of a paper published in Nature on Wednesday that may hold the answer. Mr. Jones and his colleagues developed a model that simulates what’s happening in our planet’s mantle, beneath the crust that we live on, offering a window to the center of the Earth — or close to it.<br><br>
            </div>


            Their study may one day allow a reconstruction of the history of the movement of Earth’s plates — and the processes linked to these movements over billions of years, like mass extinction events, diamond and oil deposits, and changes in climate. If you were to drill nearly 4,000 miles into the Earth, you’d reach its core, a ball of solid iron surrounded by liquid that scientists estimate is hotter than the sun. Before making it there, you’d hit the mantle — an 1,800-mile-thick layer of solid rock that can flow like a liquid, just substantially slower. This mantle is the reason plates move across the surface. It’s why we have continents, earthquakes and volcanoes. The closest anyone ever got to the mantle was a seven-mile-deep hole drilled into the crust on a peninsula in western Russia.
            But now we can better understand what’s happening below by looking at Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa, said Mr. Jones. The prevailing hypothesis has been that volcanoes like these two in Hawaii are chemical fingerprints of the Earth’s composition at the deep mantle, just at the border of its core.
            Scientists have seismic evidence that the deep part of the mantle is a graveyard where long ago slabs of earth were subducted, or thrust underneath one another, creating separate regions with different chemical compositions that eventually made their way to the surface in a hot mantle plume, or upwelling, as the core heated the rock into magma.

            But that didn’t explain the separate tracks along which the volcanoes formed.

            Giant larvaceans are one important group we need to learn more about.” In the past, other scientists have tried studying giant larvaceans in the laboratory. But these efforts always failed because the animals’ houses were too fragile to be harvested and collected specimens were never able to build houses outside the ocean.To study the zooplankton in their natural habitat, Dr. Katija and her collaborators developed a new deep-sea imaging instrument, called DeepPIV, which they paired with a remotely operated vehicle. DeepPIV projects a sheet of laser light that cuts straight through a larvacean’s mucus house. A high-definition camera on the remotely operated vehicle can then capture the inner pumping mechanisms illuminated by the laser.<br><br>

            Swimming hundreds of feet beneath the ocean’s surface in many parts of the world are prolific architects called giant larvaceans. These zooplankton are not particularly giant themselves (they resemble tadpoles and are about the size of a pinkie finger), but every day, they construct one or more spacious "houses” that can exceed three feet in length. The houses are transparent mucus structures that encase the creatures inside. Giant larvaceans beat their tails to pump seawater through these structures, which filter tiny bits of dead or drifting organic matter for the animals to eat. When their filters get clogged, the larvaceans abandon ship and construct a new house. Laden with debris from the water column, old houses rapidly sink to the seafloor. In a study published in Science Advances on Wednesday, scientists near California’s Monterey Bay have found that, through this process, giant larvaceans can filter all of the bay’s water from about 300 to 1,000 feet deep in less than two weeks, making them the fastest known zooplankton filter feeders. In doing so, the creatures help transfer carbon that has been removed from the atmosphere by photosynthesizing organisms to the deep sea, where it can be buried and stored long term. And given their abundance in other parts of the world, these organisms likely play a crucial role in the global carbon cycle. When it comes to the flow of carbon in the ocean, "we don’t know nearly as much as we should,” said Kakani Katija, a principal engineer at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute and the study’s lead author. "If we really want to understand how the system works, we have to look at all the players involved.

            These volcanoes, which have beguiled millions of tourists visiting the Hawaiian islands, have also plagued scientists with a long-running mystery: If they are so close together, how did they develop in two parallel tracks along the Hawaiian-Emperor chain formed over the same hot spot in the Pacific Ocean — and why are their chemical compositions so different? "We knew this was related to something much deeper, but we couldn’t see what,” said Tim Jones, an earth science Ph.D. student at Australian National University and the lead author of a paper published in Nature on Wednesday that may hold the answer. Mr. Jones and his colleagues developed a model that simulates what’s happening in our planet’s mantle, beneath the crust that we live on, offering a window to the center of the Earth — or close to it. Their study may one day allow a reconstruction of the history of the movement of Earth’s plates — and the processes linked to these movements over billions of years, like mass extinction events, diamond and oil deposits, and changes in climate. If you were to drill nearly 4,000 miles into the Earth, you’d reach its core, a ball of solid iron surrounded by liquid that scientists estimate is hotter than the sun. Before making it there, you’d hit the mantle — an 1,800-mile-thick layer of solid rock that can flow like a liquid, just substantially slower. This mantle is the reason plates move across the surface. It’s why we have continents, earthquakes and volcanoes. The closest anyone ever got to the mantle was a seven-mile-deep hole drilled into the crust on a peninsula in western Russia. But now we can better understand what’s happening below by looking at Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa, said Mr. Jones. The prevailing hypothesis has been that volcanoes like these two in Hawaii are chemical fingerprints of the Earth’s composition at the deep mantle, just at the border of its core. Scientists have seismic evidence that the deep part of the mantle is a graveyard where long ago slabs of earth were subducted, or thrust underneath one another, creating separate regions with different chemical compositions that eventually made their way to the surface in a hot mantle plume, or upwelling, as the core heated the rock into magma.But that didn’t explain the separate tracks along which the volcanoes formed. By examining data from the two volcanoes, Mr. Jones and his team suggested an alternative: The chemical signature, along with this double-track volcanism as it’s called, occurred three million years ago when the plates above the hot spot shifted direction, moving north. This shimmy rearranged zones of magma that are heated under different pressures in the shallower part of the mantle — when they cool, the volcanic rock that results reflects this difference. Previously stacked on top of one another, the movement of the plates exposed now geographically separates magma zones that fed the volcanoes individually.

Mauna Loa, the biggest volcano on Earth — and one of the most active — covers half the Island of Hawaii.
