# üóÉÔ∏è Archived & No Longer Maintained

I've decided to archive this library because my priorities changed a bit and I no longer have enough resources (time, money, motivation, etc.) for FOSS. There's a chance I might come back and start working on this library again in future (however, currently, I don't plan on doing that).

I won't maintain this library and it doesn't support Vue 3+, but otherwise it's still pretty usable (and if you're looking for horizontal scrollbars, you can take a look into development branch `/docs/demotests.html` which has some examples).
